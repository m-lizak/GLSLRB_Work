# GLSLRB Wetland Mapping & Analysis Scripts

This repository contains a curated collection of geospatial and remote sensing scripts developed as part of my graduate thesis work focused on wetlands mapping and classification across the Great Lakesâ€“St. Lawrence River Basin (GLSLRB). These tools automate key steps in data preprocessing, land cover classification, wetland area estimation, and terrain analysis, leveraging multi-source Earth Observation data and advanced geomorphometric methods.

## Overview

Wetlands are vital ecosystems with complex spatial patterns that require sophisticated modeling approaches for accurate mapping. This repository supports workflows that integrate Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), optical satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), and geomorphometric indices to improve wetland classification at basin-wide scales.


## Usage
The scripts are intended for researchers and practitioners in remote sensing, wetland ecology, and environmental modeling. They can be adapted for use with other regions and datasets with similar characteristics.

Before running the scripts, ensure all dependencies are installed and paths to your local data are properly configured.
